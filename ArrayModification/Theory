Python lists are mutable, meaning their content can be changed after they are created. You can modify them in various ways: 

1) Direct Assignment: 
    You can change the value of a specific element by using its index. 
2) Slicing: 
    You can modify a range of elements by assigning new values to a slice.

List Methods: Python lists have built-in methods for modification:

1) append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.
2) extend(): Adds multiple elements from an iterable to the end.
3) insert(): Inserts an element at a specified position.
4) remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.
5) pop(): Removes and returns an element at a given index (or the last element if no index is specified).
6) clear(): Removes all elements from the list
