Basic arithmetic operations
NumPy supports standard arithmetic operations like

addition, 
subtraction, 
multiplication, and 
division, which are applied element-wise to arrays.
You can use either standard operators (+, -, *, /) or 

dedicated NumPy functions (e.g., np.add(), np.subtract()).
