Aggregation functions in NumPy

Aggregation functions in NumPy allow you to summarize large datasets by computing a 
single value from a collection of numbers. These functions are optimized to work efficiently
with NumPy arrays and are essential for various data analysis and scientific computing tasks. 

Common aggregation functions

1) np.sum(): Calculates the sum of all elements in an array or along a specified axis.
2) np.prod(): Computes the product of all elements in an array or along a specified axis.
3) np.mean(): Calculates the arithmetic mean (average) of array elements, either for the entire array or along a specific axis.
4) np.std(): Computes the standard deviation of array elements, indicating data dispersion.
5) np.var(): Calculates the variance of array elements.
6) np.min(): Finds the minimum value within an array or along a particular axis.
7) np.max(): Finds the maximum value within an array or along a particular axis.
8) np.median(): Computes the median (middle value) of array elements.
9) np.percentile(): Calculates the nth percentile of array elements.
10) np.any(): Checks if any element along a given axis evaluates to True.
11) np.all(): Checks if all elements along a given axis evaluate to True
