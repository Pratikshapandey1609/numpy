## Broadcasting is process of performing the operations on different sizes of arrays 


# how numpy handle different sizes of arrys

1) matching dimensions -- if dimensions are equal operations    perform 
   [1,2,3] + [4,5,6] = [5,7,9]


2) Expending single dimensions -->
   [1 , 2, 3] + [10] --> [11,12,13]

3) Incompatible dimension type 
   [1,2,3] + [1,2] -----> it gives error
