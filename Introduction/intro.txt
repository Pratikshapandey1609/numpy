NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental, open-source Python library 
designed to handle large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices efficiently. 
It also provides a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays, 
making it essential for scientific and numerical computing in Python


key features :---

1) Efficient Multi-dimensional Arrays:
2) Homogeneous Data Types:
3) Vectorized Operations:
4) Broadcasting
5) Foundation for Other Libraries:
6) fast Calculations
